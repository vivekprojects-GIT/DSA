# 📌 Python Basics: Variables and Printing
# ---------------------------------------------
# This is your first step in learning Python.
# Let's learn what a variable is, how to create it,
# and how to show it using the print() function.
# ---------------------------------------------


# ---------------------------------------------
# ✨ Step 1: What is a Variable?
# A variable is like a container or a box.
# You can use it to store information like words or numbers.

# 👉 Example:
# Imagine you want to remember your name, your favorite subject, and your level.
# You can store each of them in a variable.

course_name = "Learning Python"      # This is a text (also called a 'string')
current_topic = "Variables and Printing"
learning_level = 1                   # This is a number (called an 'integer')


# ---------------------------------------------
# ✨ Step 2: What is print()?
# The print() function shows the output on the screen.
# It helps you check what your variables contain.

# 👉 Example:
# Let's print the variables we created.

print("📘 Course Name:", course_name)
print("📚 Topic:", current_topic)
print("⭐ Level:", learning_level)

# When you run this program, it will show:
# 📘 Course Name: Learning Python
# 📚 Topic: Variables and Printing
# ⭐ Level: 1


# ---------------------------------------------
# ✅ Summary - What You Learned:
# 1. Variables help you store information.
# 2. Text is stored in quotes: "This is text"
# 3. Numbers are stored without quotes: 1, 2, 100
# 4. print() is used to show what’s inside the variable.
# 5. You can write anything inside print("...") to show it.

# ---------------------------------------------
# 🧠 Try This on Your Own:
# Change the values of the variables below and run the code again.
# See how the output changes.

# Example:
# course_name = "Mastering Python"
# current_topic = "If-Else Conditions"
# learning_level = 2

# Run it and see what happens!

# 📌 Python Basics: If-Else Conditions
# ---------------------------------------------
# This lesson introduces how to make decisions in Python
# using if and else statements.
# ---------------------------------------------

# ✨ Step 1: What is if-else?
# Sometimes, you want the computer to choose between options.
# For example:
# - If the score is high → Show "Great job!"
# - Otherwise → Show "Keep practicing!"

# This is done using if-else conditions.

# 👉 Example:
score = 85

# Let's check if the score is greater than or equal to 90
if score >= 90:
    print("🏆 Excellent! You nailed it!")
else:
    print("💪 Good try! Keep practicing!")

# Output here will be:
# 💪 Good try! Keep practicing!
# Because 85 is not greater than or equal to 90

# ---------------------------------------------
# ✨ Step 2: More Examples

# 👇 Change the score and see what happens
score = 92

if score >= 90:
    print("🎉 You are in the top group!")
else:
    print("📚 You can improve even more!")

# Output:
# 🎉 You are in the top group!

# ---------------------------------------------
# ✅ Summary - What You Learned:
# - if checks if a condition is true
# - else runs if the condition is not true
# - You can compare numbers using:
#     > (greater than)
#     < (less than)
#     == (equal to)
#     >= (greater than or equal to)
#     <= (less than or equal to)
#     != (not equal to)

# ---------------------------------------------
# 🧠 Try This On Your Own:
# age = 16
# if age >= 18:
#     print("You can vote!")
# else:
#     print("You’re too young to vote!")

# Try changing the value of age and run the program again.

# 📌 Python Basics: Lists (Arrays) and For Loops
# ---------------------------------------------
# In this lesson, you’ll learn:
# - Why we use lists instead of many variables
# - How to access items from a list
# - How to use for loops to go through lists
# ---------------------------------------------

# 🧠 Problem:
# Imagine you have many boxes, and each box has a number.
# You want to count how many boxes contain the number 1.

# ---------------------------------------------
# ❌ Method 1: Using separate variables (not a good idea)

number1 = 1
number2 = 4
number3 = 8
number4 = 7
number5 = 0

# This is hard to manage if we have 1000s of numbers!
print(number1)
print(number2)
print(number3)
print(number4)
print(number5)

# ---------------------------------------------
# ✅ Method 2: Use a list to store all numbers

numbers = [1, 4, 8, 7, 0]   # This is a list (also called an array)

# Accessing list elements one by one
print(numbers[0])  # Shows 1
print(numbers[1])  # Shows 4
print(numbers[2])  # Shows 8
print(numbers[3])  # Shows 7
print(numbers[4])  # Shows 0

# Much easier than declaring variables one by one!

# ---------------------------------------------
# 🧠 Mini Tip:
# Indexing in Python starts from 0
# So numbers[0] is the first item

# ---------------------------------------------
# ❌ Wrong way: Using curly braces like this will create a set (unordered)
# This will cause an error if you try to access by index
# names = { "Boom", "Anvi", "nikhil", "ram" }
# print(names[0]) ← ❌ this won’t work

# ✅ Correct way: Use a list with square brackets
names = ["Boom", "Anvi", "Nikhil", "Ram"]

# ---------------------------------------------
# ✅ For Loops in Python

# 🔁 Method 1: Using range with index
for i in range(4):  # 0 to 3
    print("Name at index", i, "is:", names[i])

# 🔁 Method 2: Directly using each item
for name in names:
    print("Hello", name + "!")

# ---------------------------------------------
# ✅ Summary - What You Learned:
# - Lists store multiple values in one variable.
# - You can access items using indexes (starting at 0).
# - for loops help you go through each item in a list.
# - range(n) gives numbers from 0 to n-1.

# ---------------------------------------------
# 🧠 Try This:
# Create your own list of 5 numbers.
# Use a loop to:
# 1. Print each number
# 2. Count how many times the number 1 appears
